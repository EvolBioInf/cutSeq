    \section{Introduction}
    Molecular sequence data, especially DNA sequence data, are among the
    longest texts we have. A single \textit{Escherichia coli} genome with
    its 4.4--5.6 million nucleotides occupies more space than the King
    James Bible with its 4.1 characters. Yet, like the bible, where the
    focus is often on a few verses, sequences are often cut up into bits
    of interest. The purpose of \texttt{cutSeq} is to do that. It takes as
    input one or more sequences in FASTA format and outputs one or more
    regions from each of them. The regions can either be entered on the
    command line or supplied in a file. On the command line, regions to be
    cut are denoted
    \[
    \texttt{-r s1-e1,s2-e2}
    \]
    that is, pairs of start and end positions are separated by commas,
    while the start and end positions are separated by hyphens.

    Start positions go from 1 to the length of the sequence, and
    intervals are denoted including the end position. For example, if
    $S=\texttt{CATCTTTTGT}$, then the interval $(3,5)$ is
    $S[3..5]=\texttt{TCT}$.

    If the intervals are supplied in a file, it consists of pairs of
    start and end positions separated by a blank, one pair per line:
    \begin{center}
    \texttt{s1 e2}\\
    \texttt{s2 e2}
    \end{center}
    By default, \texttt{cutSeq} prints each region individually. However,
    it can also concatenate the regions thus imitating the splicing of
    pre-mRNA to mRNA.

    \section{Implementation}
    The program is based on data structures for representing intervals and
    sequences. These data structures are handled by functions, which need
    to be declared. Data structures, functions, and their declarations are
    bookended by a section for including header files at the top and the
    \texttt{main} function at the end.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<cutSeq.c>>=
  // <<Include headers>>
  // <<Data structures>>
  // <<Function declarations>>
  // <<Function definitions>>
  // <<Main function>>
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  Everything is based on the data structures for intervals and
  sequences, so they are implemented first, together with functions for
  handling them.
  \subsection{Intervals}
  An interval consists of a start position and an end position.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Data structures>>=
  typedef struct interval {
    int start;
    int end;
  } Interval;
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  Usually, an array of intervals is considered, rather than a single one.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Data structures>>=
  typedef struct intervalArr {
    Interval **arr;
    int n;
  } IntervalArr;
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
Intervals are created, which is declared
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Function declarations>>=
  Interval *newInterval(int s, int e);
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  and implemented.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Function definitions>>=
  Interval *newInterval(int s, int e) {
    Interval *i = (Interval *)emalloc(sizeof(Interval));
    i->start = s;
    i->end = e;
    return i;
  }
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  The function \texttt{emalloc} for memory allocation is defined in
  \texttt{error.h}.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Include headers>>=
  #include "error.h"
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  Similarly, interval arrays are created with a function that is first
  declared
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Function declarations>>=
  IntervalArr *newIntervalArr();
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  and then implemented as an empty array.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Function definitions>>=
  IntervalArr *newIntervalArr() {
    IntervalArr *ia = (IntervalArr *)emalloc(sizeof(IntervalArr));
    ia->arr = NULL;
    ia->n = 0;
    return ia;
  }
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  To add an interval to an existing interval array, declare the
  corresponding function
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Function declarations>>=
  void intervalArrAdd(IntervalArr *ia, Interval *i);
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  and implement it.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Function definitions>>=
  void intervalArrAdd(IntervalArr *ia, Interval *i) {
    ia->arr = (Interval **)erealloc(ia->arr, sizeof(Interval *));
    ia->arr[ia->n++] = i;
  }
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  When an interval array is not needed any more, it is freed. The
  function for this is declared
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Function declarations>>=
  void freeIntervalArr(IntervalArr *ia);
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  and implemented.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Function definition>>=
  void freeIntervalArr(IntervallArr *ia) {
    for (int i = 0; i < = ia->n; i++)
      free(ia->arr[i]);
    free(ia);
  }
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  These are all the stock interval functions required. Sequences, once
  defined, also rely on functions for construction, destruction, and
  addition.
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  \subsection{Main function}
  The \texttt{main} function directs the rest of the program. It
  communicates with the user, reads the intervals to be cut out, and
  deals with the input files.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Main function>>=
  int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    FILE *fp;
    // <<Communicate with the user>>
    // <<Get intervals>>
    // <<Deal with input files>>
    return 0;
  }
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  When communicating with the user, the program name is first set, in
  case it needs to be retrieved later on. Then the list of arguments is
  obtained and the arguments are checked to see whether the user
  requested program information or help. There might even be an error in
  the input.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Communicate with the user>>=
  setprogname(argv[0]);
  Args *args = getArgs(argc, argv);
  if (args->v)
    printSplash(args);
  else if (args->h || args->err)
    printUsage();
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  The function \texttt{setprogname} is part of the BSD standard library,
  while the functions \texttt{getArgs}, \texttt{printSplash}, and
  printUsage() are declared in \texttt{interface.h}.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Include headers>>=
  #include <bsd/stdlib.h>
  #include "interface.h"
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  The intervals supplied by the user are delivered either on the command
  line as an argument of the \texttt{-r} option, or via a file whose
  name is the argument of the \texttt{-f} option. In both cases they are
  delivered as an interval array.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Get intervals>>=
  IntervalArr *ia = newIntervalArr();
  if (args->r) {
    // <<Read intervals from command line>>
  } else {
    // <<Read intervals from file>>
  }
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  The intervals are read from the command line by splitting the argument
  of \texttt{-r} first along the commas, then each start/end pair along
  its hyphen.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Read intervals from command line>>=
  char *token;
  while ((token = strsep(&(args->r), ",")) != NULL) {
    char *s = strsep(&token, "-");
    char *e = strsep(&token, "-");
    Interval *i = newInterval(atoi(s), atoi(e));
    intervalArrAdd(ia, i);
  }
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  The function \texttt{strsep} is declared in \texttt{string.h},
  \texttt{atoi} in \texttt{stdlib.h}.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Include headers>>=
  #include <string.h>
  #include <stdlib.h>
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  To read intervals from a file, it is opened, parsed, and closed again.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Read intervals from file>>=
  fp = efopen(args->f, "r");
  int s, e;
  while (fscanf(fp, "%d %d\n", &s, &e) != EOF) {
    Interval *i = newInterval(s, e);
    intervalArrAdd(ia, i);
  }
  fclose(fp);
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  The function \texttt{efopen} is defined in \texttt{error.h}, which
  is already included. The functions \texttt{fscanf} and \texttt{fclose}
  are declared in \texttt{stdio.h}.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Include headers>>=
  #include <stdio.h>
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  Conventional UNIX programs iterate across all input files, and read
  from the standard input stream if there are no input
  files; so does \texttt{cutSeq}.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Deal with input files>>=
  for (int i = 0; i < args->nf; i++) {
    fp = efopen(args->fi[i], "r");
    scanFile(fp, ia, args);
    fclose(fp);
  }
  if (!args->nf) {
    fp = stdin;
    scanFile(fp, ia, args);
  }
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  The function \texttt{scanFile} is declared
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Function declarations>>=
  void scanFile(FILE *fp, IntervalArr *ia, Args *args);
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  and implemented such that for each sequence read the fragments are
  either printed spliced together or as separate fragments. If only a
  single fragment is extracted, splicing makes no sense and the
  \emph{separate} mode of printing is used regardless of whether or not
  the splicing option (\texttt{-s}) is switched on.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Function definitions>>=
  void scanFile(FILE *fp, IntervalArr *ia, Args *args) {
    Seq *seq;
    while ((seq = getSeq(fp)) != NULL) {
      if (args->s && ia->n > 1) {
	// <<Print spliced fragments>>
      } else {
	// <<Print separate fragments>>
      }
    }
  }
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  The \texttt{Seq} data structure for handling sequences is declared in \texttt{seq.h}.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Include headers>>=
  #include "seq.h"
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  Each fragment is printed as a header plus its interval, followed by
  the sequence data.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Print separate fragments>>=
  for (int i = 0; i < ia->n; i++) {
    int s = ia->arr[i]->start;
    int e = ia->arr[i]->end;
    printf(">%s %d..%d\n", seq->name, s, e);
    printStr(seq->data + s - 1, e - s + 1, args->l);
  }
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  The new function \texttt{printStr} takes as argument a character
  array, of which it prints the first \texttt{n} characters in lines of
  length \texttt{l}. The function is declared
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Function declarations>>=
  void printStr(char *s, int n, int l);
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  and implemented.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Function definitions>>=
  void printStr(char *s, int n, int l) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      printf("%c", s[i]);
      if ((i + 1) % l == 0)
	printf("\n");
    }
    if (n % l != 0)
      printf("\n");
  }
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  When printing, say, two spliced fragments, the header has the
  structure
  \[
  >\mbox{name} \mbox{join}(s_1..e_1,s_2..e_2)
  \]
  Followed by the spliced sequence string. So there are three steps,
  printing the header, constructing the spliced sequence string, and
  printing the sequence string. The last step is already available in
  the function \texttt{printStr} just implemented.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Print spliced fragments>>=
  char *splicedSeq;
  int n;
  //<<Print spliced header>>
  //<<Construct spliced sequence>>
  printStr(splicedSeq, n, args->l);
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  The header of a spliced sequence is printed by looping across the
  intervals involved.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Print spliced header>>=
  int s = ia->arr[0]->start;
  int e = ia->arr[0]->end;
  printf(">%s join(%d..%d", seq->name, s, e);
  for (int i = 1; i < ia->n; i++) {
    s = ia->arr[i]->start;
    e = ia->arr[i]->end;
    printf(",%d..%d", s, e);
  }
  printf(")\n");
#+end_src
#+begin_src latex
  The spliced sequence is constructed by finding its length and
  allocating the corresponding space into which the individual residues
  are then copied.
#+end_src
#+begin_src C <<Construct spliced sequence>>=
  n = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < ia->n; i++)
    n += ia->arr[i]->end - ia->arr[i]->start + 1;
  splicedSeq = emalloc(n);
  n = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < ia->n; i++) {
    s = ia->arr[i]->start - 1;
    e = ia->arr[i]->end - 1;
    for (int j = s; j <= e; j++)
      splicedSeq[n++] = seq->data[j];
  }
